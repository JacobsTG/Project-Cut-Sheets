# Internet of Things Project
## Status Board
### Last Updated:  2016-06-01

### Proposal Summary
We have developed a public webpage that displays the following items in a 2x2 grid:
  * Current temperature and humidity
  * A 36 hour temperature graph
  * A 60 minute precipitation probability graph
  * The current Jacobs stock price and a 24 hour graph of the Jacobs stock price
We would like to use low cost Internet of Things (IoT) hardware to display this webpage to Jacobs TG employees in the SDL on a wall-mounted 55" TV.

### Proposal Details
A group of Jacobs TG employees have devoted our personal time and effort to the development of this project because we have a desire to work together on an IoT project that peaks our interest.  This group is interested in using this project, and future projects, to further our personal software development skills, and work together on a fun, self-directed project.  

We plan to use software development tools that are used by smaller, asynchronous, geographically separated, software development teams to keep us focused on our project goals.  We feel the IoT, and software development tool knowledge we will gain in this effort will be helpful in future Jacobs TG projects by allowing us to choose which of these tools will be helpful in the future when/if our current set of software development tools need to be replaced, or when a new project or client forces us to use a new tool to accomplish the job.

We consider the currently proposed 2x2 grid of status board "widgets" this project's first revision.  We have several ideas for future status board widgets (partial list below), but feel these widgets would serve as a good starting point for this effort.  As this group proposes other IoT projects, we plan to incorporate the data produced from these projects as status board widgets.

### Future Status Board Widgets
- Welcome "client" message
- Completed client work PPT slides / images
- NASA Image of the Day
- Current lab, high bay, and office temperature and humidity
- Project ship dates
- Upcoming important dates (monthly accounting dates, paydays, group events, etc.)
